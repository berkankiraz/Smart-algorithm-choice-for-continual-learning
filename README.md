# Smart-algorithm-choice-for-continual-learning

This algorithm was started to be used in fixed security cameras. A system that adapts to the weather and time of the day is being developed. The aim of the project is to develop an algorithm that can make a smart and continuous choice for continual learning.

The first algorithm is intended to be trained and frozen with night images. The other algorithm will be trained with daytime images. Currently, which algorithm will be selected according to pixel values has been made.



# Future Work

It is aimed to make these selections with the clustering method. The reason for choosing the clustering algorithm is to ensure that the system is adaptive.


Progress will be recorded regularly.
