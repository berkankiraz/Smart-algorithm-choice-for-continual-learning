# Smart-algorithm-choice-for-continual-learning

This algorithm was started to be used in fixed security cameras. A system that adapts to the weather and time of the day is being developed. The aim of the project is to develop an algorithm that can make a smart and continuous choice for continual learning.


Progress will be recorded regularly.
